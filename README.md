# IntelliJ VS-Code Cheat Sheet

I use both an IntellJ based IDE (PyCharm) and Visual Studio Code IDE.

I created this cheat sheet to help me to learn VS Code.

## find Action || Command Palette

Goal: Avoid to navigate with the menu to a setting/action. Use autocomplete to get there.

IntelliJ: ctrl+shift+A "find Action"
