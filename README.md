# IntelliJ VS-Code Cheat Sheet

I use both an IntellJ based IDE (PyCharm) and Visual Studio Code IDE.

I created this cheat sheet to help me to learn VS Code.

## find Action || Command Palette

Goal: Avoid to navigate with the menu to a setting/action. Use autocomplete to get there.

IntelliJ: ctrl+shift+A "find Action"

VS Code: ctrl+shift+P "Command Palette"

## Open Previous Recently Use File

Goal: switch between two files as fast as possible. Background: I almost always code in two files for a commit. One file contains the production code, the other file contains the tests. Switching between both files should be super fast and easy.
Since I use `ctrl+e` in Chrome ([Chrome Plugin Quick Tabs](https://github.com/guettli/desktop-tips-and-tricks/blob/95ed52cf5a5ae44b0754057640ced34f2050cfb0/README.md#chrome-extension-quick-tabs)) I want to have the same here.

IntelliJ: ctrl-e ENTER

VS Code: ctrl-e After following [this configuration](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64129954/633961)
